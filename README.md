# SoccerPredictions

## Description
SoccerPredictions is a Python-based project that analyzes soccer data and provides predictions based on various statistical models. The project aims to assist users in understanding soccer performance metrics and making informed predictions about match outcomes.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the individual scripts to analyze data or make predictions. Here are some examples:

- To run the decision tree model:
  ```bash
  python decisionTree.py
  ```

- To run the random forest model:
  ```bash
  python randomForest.py
  ```

- To run the multiple linear regression model:
  ```bash
  python mlr.py
  ```

## Scripts Overview
- `decisionTree.py`: Implements a decision tree algorithm for predicting match outcomes.
- `randomForest.py`: Uses a random forest model to enhance prediction accuracy.
- `mlr.py`: Applies multiple linear regression for statistical analysis of soccer data.
- `main.py`: Run all three files and get the best model.
